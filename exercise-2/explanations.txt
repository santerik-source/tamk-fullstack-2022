1. React is a way of building websites with java resources. It's name comes from the fast response
of the real-time development feedback that it gives.

2. React components are buildings blocks and make up the react projects. If some of these are lacking
the project will fail to run.

3. A website with only a single "activity", meaning it does not have any redirecting built in,
only its initial page what it loads is built in.

4. Declarative programming focuses on giving freedom to the language used to achieve its goals,
instead of the imperative programming that uses strict algorithmic guidelines to build the end results,
without any regard about the language used in programming

5. JSX could be called the additional personality of react. They define and give additional characteristics to already existing components.

6. Asynchronous development basically means that different objectives take their own time of development.
Synchronous is real time and/or working in tandem with other parts at the same time; requiring their working also for the module to be developed on.

Its basically like normal computers which can process one thing at a time vs quantum computers
